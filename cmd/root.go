	Short: "A testing automation tool that utilizes SimPOS REST API.",
	Long: `Simpos Bot, or spb for short, is a CLI-based testing automation tool. 
It utilizes the SimPOS REST API to automate testing efforts.
Its main strengths are light-weight and extensible.

Version: 

Usage examples:
	spb run --file <config file> ==> Run predefined test cases in a config file.
	spb run --queue reversal/adjustment/both ==> Run either the reversal, adjustment queue, or both.`,
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
func Execute() {
	cobra.CheckErr(rootCmd.Execute())
}

func init() {
	// cobra.OnInitialize(initConfig)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.
	// Cobra supports persistent flags, which, if defined here,
	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.simposbot.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
	// rootCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
